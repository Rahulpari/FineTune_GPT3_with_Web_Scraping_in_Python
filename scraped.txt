The Open Contracting Data Standard

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), is a free, non-proprietary open data standard for public contracting, implemented by over 30 governments around the world.
It is the only international open standard for the publication of information related to the planning, procurement, and implementation of public contracts and has been endorsed by the G20, the G7 and major international organizations.
The OCDS describes how to publish data and documents at all stages of the contracting process. It was created to support organizations to increase contracting transparency and enable deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.
The OCDS provides:

A set of recommended data fields and documents to publish;
A common structured data model;
Guidance and tools to support implementation and data use;
Profiles for Public Private Partnerships, Infrastructure Projects, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Government Procurement;
Toolkits such as the Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard (OC4IDS) to connect contracts to project-level information and publish standardized data on infrastructure projects;
An extension mechanism to add additional key information to your OCDS data; and
A free data support team.

The Open Contracting Data Standard model


The Data Standard describes a way to model and publish data along the whole public contracting process. It is not an e-procurement solution or information management system. The OCDS can, however, be used to inform e-procurement (eGP) system database design and the information contained in such systems can be published according to the standard and used for visualization, monitoring, and analysis. As the information is standardized, it is much easier to adapt and reuse tools from others.

Uptake of the OCDS around the world 

The Open Contracting Data Standard is an internationally accepted standard with a growing community of users in 30+ countries. This means that approaches to monitoring and measuring improvements can be shared across jurisdictions.
Currently, the OCDS is being implemented by 30+ national and subnational governments all over the world, including Australia, Buenos Aires, Chile, Colombia, France, Paraguay, UK, Ukraine and Zambia. We maintain a list of links to OCDS publishers.
The European Commission is aligning its publication with OCDS through improvements to its eForms (i.e. the standards used to publish information about public procurement under the EU Directives) and the work of its eProcurement Ontology Working Group. With respect to eForms, many of the changes that the EU recently adopted were inspired and informed by the OCDS, both directly and indirectly, whether in terms of modelling (example) or in terms of the more general increase in the use of codelists and identifiers. The European Commission is also promoting OCDS implementation by member states as part of contract registers. It has given Italy and Finland funding to do so through its Connecting Europe Funding Facility.
The G7 and G20 have both endorsed open contracting principles, they are embedded into the OECD’s Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems. Open contracting is recommended as a transformational reform by the Open Government Partnership.
Finally, using the OCDS can save both time and money as a lot of the work in publishing and making procurement information accessible has been done for you. The OCDS is free to use and backed by a data support team.
In addition to a detailed technical documentation, the OCDS is also accompanied by tools for validation, tools for conversion between nested (JSON) and tabular (CSV) data formats, and guidance for API development.
There are many reusable tools developed by both the OCP and the wider community. To get the same usability for value for money and other analysis, much time and money would go into developing a localized data model that would not be comparable with data from other countries or compatible with international validation and visualization tools.

How can I participate in the governance of OCDS?

The Open Contracting Data Standard has an open and inclusive governance process that is free for all to participate. All discussion related to the OCDS takes place in the open in the standard’s repository.
We invite publishers and data users to participate in peer reviews as part of the upgrade governance process. For example, in the 1.1 upgrade, we had peer review participation from Australia, Canada, the EU, Mexico, Nigeria, Paraguay, the US, and the World Bank (in addition to the many who participated throughout the consultation and prioritization periods).
We are currently under the process of developing the next minor release of the Open Contracting Data Standard, OCDS 1.2. To get updates about the process, please subscribe to the standard-discuss mailing list.

Why implement the Open Contracting Data Standard

Contracting data published in an OCDS format is easier to share, compare and analyze. It allows publishers to adapt and reuse existing visualization and analysis tools, reducing costs and promoting innovation. The OCDS provides guidance on what to publish and how to publish the most important details about public contracting as identified by practitioners, researchers and other stakeholders.
The OCDS was crafted for four specific user needs, underpinned by a field-by-field analysis of how the data can be used to support those needs. They are:

Delivering better value for money, saving government money and time;
Building a fairer business environment and a level playing field for suppliers; and
Improving public integrity by deterring fraud and corruption; and
Tracking and improving service delivery.

Embedded into wider reforms, governments can use open contracting to secure better value for money for goods, works, and services and to build the trust of the private sector, civil society and citizens.

Announcing AI21 Studio and Jurassic-1 language modelsAI21 Labs’ new developer platform offers instant access to our 178B-parameter language model, to help you build sophisticated text-based AI applications at scaleWe are thrilled to announce the launch of AI21 Studio, our new developer platform where you can use our state-of-the-art Jurassic-1 language models to build your own applications and services. Jurassic-1 models come in two sizes, where the Jumbo version, at 178B parameters, is the largest and most sophisticated language model ever released for general use by developers. AI21 Studio is currently in open beta, allowing anyone to sign up and immediately start querying Jurassic-1 using our API and interactive web environment.Our mission at AI21 Labs is to fundamentally reimagine the way humans read and write by introducing machines as thought partners, and the only way we can achieve this is if we take on this challenge together. We’ve been researching language models since our Mesozoic Era (aka 2017 😉). Jurassic-1 builds on this research, and it is the first generation of models we’re making available for widespread use.Jurassic-1 models are highly versatile, capable of both human-like text generation, as well as solving complex tasks such as question answering, text classification and many others. Our models utilize a unique 250,000-token vocabulary which is not only much larger than most existing vocabularies (5x or more), but also the first to include multi-word tokens such as expressions, phrases, and named entities. Because of this, Jurassic-1 needs fewer tokens to represent a given amount of text, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing latency significantly. Jurassic-1 in action, generating blog post ideas in AI21 Studio.‍Check out our white paper for more technical details, as well as a thorough evaluation of our models.In order to help developers scale their applications beyond a proof-of-concept and efficiently serve production-scale traffic, AI21 Studio allows developers to train custom versions of Jurassic-1 models. Training a custom model is easy and requires as few as 50-100 training examples. Once trained, your custom model is served in AI21 Studio and immediately available for your exclusive use.We created AI21 Studio to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technology. Using Jurassic-1 within AI21 Studio, you can quickly build text-based applications that rival those being dreamed up in the world’s biggest labs, even if you have no prior experience. We’ve been using AI21 Studio internally to power our own applications, and it has propelled our product development immensely. Now it’s your turn.‍GET STARTED NOW‍To learn more, visit our blog posts highlighting different use-cases for Jurassic-1 and demonstrating how to bootstrap a custom model in AI21 Studio or read the AI21 Studio documentation.‍Read our official press release.ABOUT THE AUTHOREnjoyed this?Stay up to date with the latest research and updates from AI21 Labs.Thank you!

MRKL Whitepaper


Paper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Language ModelsTry for yourself


Contact us for early accessWhat is a MRKL system?In August 2021 we released Jurassic-1, a 178B-parameter autoregressive language model. We’re thankful for the reception it got – over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. Mega models such as Jurassic-1, GPT-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. But these models are also inherently limited. They can’t access your company database, don’t have access to current information (for example, latest COVID numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), can’t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities don’t come close to that of an HP calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. Here’s how it works.Compositive multi-expert problem: the list of “Green energy companies” is routed to Wiki API, “last month” dates are extracted from the calendar and “share prices” from the database. The “largest increase“ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model.There are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. To get a deeper sense for MRKL systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our MRKL paper. For a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega LMs.A further look at the advantages of Jurassic-XEven without diving into technical details, it’s easy to get a sense for the advantages of Jurassic-X. Here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications.Reading and updating your databases in free languageAI-assisted content generation on current affairsPerforming simple and complex math operations.Decomposing multi-step problemsAccess to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates)Transparency and trustReading and updating your database in free languageLanguage models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. However, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your company’s payroll, the grades in your school and more. Jurassic-X can connect to your databases so that you can ‘talk’ to your data to explore what you need-  “Find the cheapest Shampoo that has a rosy smell”, “Which computing stock increased the most in the last week?” and more. Furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below).Jurassic-X enables you to plug in YOUR company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free languageAI-assisted text generation on current affairsLanguage models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. This is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the world’s leading language models (including our own Jurassic-1) still claim Donald Trump is the US president more than a year after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Jurassic-X solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as Wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. This opens up a new avenue for AI-assisted text generation on current affairs.Who is the president of the United States?T0Donald Trump





GPT-3Donald Trump





Jurassic-1Donald Trump





GoogleJoe Biden




Jurassic-XJoe Biden is the46th and currentpresident




Jurassic-X can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to WikidataPerforming math operationsA 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. In contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. With increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an HP calculator from the 1970s. Jurassic-X takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. The problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). The computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. Importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. In contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use.The company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. How many did each employee get?T094 employees.





GPT-3Each employee got 7000 stocks





Jurassic-11.5





Google(No answer provided)




Jurassic-X6972.3X= 655400/94




Jurassic-X can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculatorCompositionalitySolving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - “Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?” requires answering: i. What is the population of Tel-Aviv? ii. What is the population of Berlin? iii. Which is larger? This is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). Moreover, the user can’t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. Jurassic-X can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. Importantly, Jurassic-X not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system.Do more people live in Tel Aviv or in Berlin?T0Berlin




GPT-3There are more people living in Tel Aviv than in Berlin.





Jurassic-1Berlin and Tel Aviv are roughly the same size





Google(First hit is a comparison between Tel Aviv and Berlin)




Jurassic-XMore people live in Berlin than in Tel-Aviv




[‘Return population of Tel Aviv’; Return population of Berlin’; Return which is bigger between #1 and #2’]Step 1: Population of Tel Aviv. Result - 451523.Step 1: Population of Berlin. Result - 3664088.Step 3: Which is bigger,  #1 or #2. Result - Berlin.Jurassic-X breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. Importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the systemDynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates)Certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. Such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by Jurassic-X by integrating it with a reliable source of information. We performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case.Weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while Jurassic-X provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction.I’m going to be in New-York in 3 days. Should I pack my umbrella?T0No





GPT-3Yes, you should pack your umbrella.




Jurassic-1Yes, you should. The weather forecast is rain.




Google(Links to weather websites)




Jurassic-XYes, you should pack your umbrella, because in New York in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees.




Currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the Jurassic-X concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well.How much Moroccan money will I get for 100 bucks?T0125 dirhams





GPT-3100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$.





Jurassic-1How much is 100 dollars in moroccan money?





Google100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars





Jurassic-X100 USD = 934.003 MAD




Jurassic-X combines a language model with access to APIs with continuously changing information. This is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sourcesTransparency and trustTransparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. This lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - “Was Clinton ever elected as president of the United States?”. The answer, of course, depends on which Clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by Jurassic-X that has a component for disambiguation. More examples of Jurassic-X’s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting.Was Clinton ever elected president of the United States?T0Yes





GPT-3No, Clinton was never elected as president of the United States.





Jurassic-1No





GoogleClinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential elections…




Jurassic-XBill Clinton was elected president.




Jurassic-X is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box responseYour TurnThat's it, you get the picture. The use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with Jurassic-X, but now it's your turn. A MRKL system such as Jurassic-X is as flexible as your imagination.

Projects and Tenders
The infrastructure industry is the largest global economic sector but advanced data and AI methods are yet to be applied to help increase efficiency and social impact. Infrastructure is Industry of Industries but there is a commonality, whether be bridges, data centers, solar, power, or roads, there’s a common pain point: How to (a) source deals, (b) evaluate deals more completely and quickly.  
Primary stakeholders are Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPCs) and Government. Third parties include Suppliers, Infrastructure investors, Insurance, Consultants.Generally, opportunities in the infrastructure space are fragmented across the internet and largely a human-network-driven tacit knowledge opportunity scoping.  
Unstructured data from individual government tenders sites, public-private partnership project opportunities, private projects, and news sites, or industry-specific (for example, airports, or hospitals) construction project sites. We built a flexible live data stream accounting for global standards related to the sector, sub-sector, project stage, and over 30 specific parameters. We use a hybrid approach to use language models to generate tags associated with important industry fields.  
Problem: Massive data and knowledge gaps lead to heavy reliance on consultants and an opaque marketplace to find relevant partners. Incomplete data with lack of standards on opportunity (world’s largest marketplace public procurement $13T annually) and associated risks. We interviewed 100s of people from over 55 organizations.
EPCs: Upto 15% of EPC’s operating expense is spent on identifying and benchmarking opportunities. Still they are only getting a window to 30-40% of the available opportunity set.  
Project Owners (Government): Initiators have very little info to get them up to speed or learn on the projects they are about to undertake.
The primary sources for opportunity set include:

Projects, such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank, or industry sites such as InfraPPPWorld, Inframation, Airport-Technology.
Official Government Public Procurement Tenders Websites
News data
Country PPP sites, for example, Canada P3 Spectrum or India Investment Grid, and India PPP site

The opportunity set data offers two key use-cases:

Opportunity Searching: Search, filter, and discover new projects, and aggregated trending tenders
Opportunity Benchmarking: Find similar projects that are recently released, early detection, closed (successfully or distressed).

                California Winter Weather 
            

Through March 25: a cold storm system is expected to bring low-level snow, rain and gusty winds.  
March 27-28: another storm system is anticipated to bring heavy mountain snow, potentially heavy rain, and gusty winds. 
Cumulative impacts from Atmospheric Rivers are still affecting California and may intensify conditions.
Never drive around a safety barrier or road closure sign of any kind, or through flooded areas. As little as one foot of water can sweep a car off the road.
Winter Driving Tips: be prepared, pack your patience and travel safely. 
If you must travel, know before you go:  National Weather Service  -  Caltrans Social Media  -  Road Information or call 1-800-427-7623  -  QuickMap Real-time Travel Information

Through a series of system-wide optimizations, we’ve achieved 90% cost reduction for ChatGPT since December; we’re now passing through those savings to API users. Developers can now use our open-source Whisper large-v2 model in the API with much faster and cost-effective results. ChatGPT API users can expect continuous model improvements and the option to choose dedicated capacity for deeper control over the models. We’ve also listened closely to feedback from our developers and refined our API terms of service to better meet their needs.Get startedEarly users of ChatGPT and Whisper APIsSnap Inc., the creator of Snapchat, introduced My AI for Snapchat+ this week. The experimental feature is running on ChatGPT API. My AI offers Snapchatters a friendly, customizable chatbot at their fingertips that offers recommendations, and can even write a haiku for friends in seconds. Snapchat, where communication and messaging is a daily behavior, has 750 million monthly Snapchatters:Play videoMy AI for Snapchat+Quizlet is a global learning platform with more than 60 million students using it to study, practice and master whatever they’re learning. Quizlet has worked with OpenAI for the last three years, leveraging GPT-3 across multiple use cases, including vocabulary learning and practice tests. With the launch of ChatGPT API, Quizlet is introducing Q-Chat, a fully-adaptive AI tutor that engages students with adaptive questions based on relevant study materials delivered through a fun chat experience:Play videoQuizlet Q-ChatInstacart is augmenting the Instacart app to enable customers to ask about food and get inspirational, shoppable answers. This uses ChatGPT alongside Instacart’s own AI and product data from their 75,000+ retail partner store locations to help customers discover ideas for open-ended shopping goals, such as “How do I make great fish tacos?” or “What’s a healthy lunch for my kids?” Instacart plans to launch “Ask Instacart” later this year:Play videoInstacart’s Ask InstacartShop, Shopify’s consumer app, is used by 100 million shoppers to find and engage with the products and brands they love. ChatGPT API is used to power Shop’s new shopping assistant. When shoppers search for products, the shopping assistant makes personalized recommendations based on their requests. Shop’s new AI-powered shopping assistant will streamline in-app shopping by scanning millions of products to quickly find what buyers are looking for—or help them discover something new:Play videoShopify’s Shop appSpeak is an AI-powered language learning app focused on building the best path to spoken fluency. They’re the fastest-growing English app in South Korea, and are already using the Whisper API to power a new AI speaking companion product, and rapidly bring it to the rest of the globe. Whisper’s human-level accuracy for language learners of every level unlocks true open-ended conversational practice and highly accurate feedback:Play videoThe Speak appChatGPT APIModel: The ChatGPT model family we are releasing today, gpt-3.5-turbo, is the same model used in the ChatGPT product. It is priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models. It’s also our best model for many non-chat use cases—we’ve seen early testers migrate from text-davinci-003 to gpt-3.5-turbo with only a small amount of adjustment needed to their prompts.API: Traditionally, GPT models consume unstructured text, which is represented to the model as a sequence of “tokens.” ChatGPT models instead consume a sequence of messages together with metadata. (For the curious: under the hood, the input is still rendered to the model as a sequence of “tokens” for the model to consume; the raw format used by the model is a new format called Chat Markup Language (“ChatML”).)We’ve created a new endpoint to interact with our ChatGPT models:RequestResponsePython bindingsTo learn more about the ChatGPT API, visit our Chat guide.ChatGPT upgradesWe are constantly improving our ChatGPT models, and want to make these enhancements available to developers as well. Developers who use the gpt-3.5-turbo model will always get our recommended stable model, while still having the flexibility to opt for a specific model version. For example, today we’re releasing gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, which will be supported through at least June 1st, and we’ll update gpt-3.5-turbo to a new stable release in April. The models page will provide switchover updates.Dedicated instancesWe are also now offering dedicated instances for users who want deeper control over the specific model version and system performance. By default, requests are run on compute infrastructure shared with other users, who pay per request. Our API runs on Azure, and with dedicated instances, developers will pay by time period for an allocation of compute infrastructure that’s reserved for serving their requests.Developers get full control over the instance’s load (higher load improves throughput but makes each request slower), the option to enable features such as longer context limits, and the ability to pin the model snapshot.Dedicated instances can make economic sense for developers running beyond ~450M tokens per day. Additionally, it enables directly optimizing a developer’s workload against hardware performance, which can dramatically reduce costs relative to shared infrastructure. For dedicated instance inquiries, contact us.Whisper APIWhisper, the speech-to-text model we open-sourced in September 2022, has received immense praise from the developer community but can also be hard to run. We’ve now made the large-v2 model available through our API, which gives convenient on-demand access priced at $0.006 / minute. In addition, our highly-optimized serving stack ensures faster performance compared to other services.Whisper API is available through our transcriptions (transcribes in source language) or translations (transcribes into English) endpoints, and accepts a variety of formats (m4a, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, wav, webm):RequestResponsePython bindingscurl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \

We’ve made concrete changes, such as:Data submitted through the API is no longer used for service improvements (including model training) unless the organization opts inImplementing a default 30-day data retention policy for API users, with options for stricter retention depending on user needs.Removing our pre-launch review (unlocked by improving our automated monitoring)Improving developer documentationSimplifying our Terms of Service and Usage Policies, including terms around data ownership: users own the input and output of the models.For the past two months our uptime has not met our own expectations nor that of our users. Our engineering team’s top priority is now stability of production use cases—we know that ensuring AI benefits all of humanity requires being a reliable service provider. Please hold us accountable for improved uptime over the upcoming months!We believe that AI can provide incredible opportunities and economic empowerment to everyone, and the best way to achieve that is to allow everyone to build with it. We hope that the changes we announced today will lead to numerous applications that everyone can benefit from.

Pipeline Access is the GI Hub’s directory of global infrastructure pipelines
Welcome to Pipeline Access, which collates in a single location the major infrastructure pipelines in G20 countries and, soon, around the world.
In addition to serving as a directory of pipelines, which are key sources for information about current and upcoming projects and programs, this directory identifies the types of pipelines being published by different jurisdictions. As such, it is a first point of access for planners, investors, and deliverers of infrastructure to understand the state of infrastructure delivery in their chosen regions.

Types of pipelines
Investment Program: A forward-looking planning document which identifies allocated public investment and/or spending commitments ahead of project materialisation, for each infrastructure sector. Example: US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act.
Forward Pipeline: A traditional 'pipeline', which tracks expected projects from initial announcement to procurement and delivery. Example: IPA Australian New Zealand Infrastructure Pipeline.
Priority List: A static 'wish list' or recommended infrastructure project list. Projects are logged before procurement or delivery, and project evolution is not tracked. A priority list may overlap with a forward pipeline. Example: South Africa Strategic Integrated Projects.
Project Tracker: A  backward-looking record of infrastructure deals, usually those involving the private sector. These pipelines track projects from financial close to the operation stage. Generally, they track information on the deal features, completion dates, and often public expenditure and performance measurements. Example: European Commission major projects.

How prevalent are pipelines?
All G20 members and guest nations have at least one pipeline resource, and:

88% (22 of the 25) have at least one Forward Pipeline, Priority List, or Project Tracker
72% (18 of the 25) use an Investment Program
60% (15 of the 25) have at least one Forward Pipeline
52% (13 of the 25) have at least one Project Tracker
36% (9 of the 25) have at least one Priority List
Some pipeline resources have specialised focuses, for example 52% (13 of the 25) have a dedicated Public-Private Partnership resource.













More about defining 'pipelines'
Infrastructure pipelines are interpreted differently based on who is using the pipeline and for what purpose. Considering the definitions used by multilateral development banks, international organisations, and other leading entities around the world, the GI Hub proposes this definition:

An infrastructure pipeline is a tool that sets forth credible and/or expected infrastructure project investments or procurements across a reasonable time horizon, providing details that can be used by stakeholders to plan and prioritise their resources to invest in and/or deliver the specified projects."

Although the term 'pipeline' is usually used to refer to forward-looking pipelines that capture projects from early government announcements and feasibility studies to the procurement stage, the definition used here is deliberately broad. It covers a wide scope, from the upstream stage of project identification with infrastructure investment programs to project completion and operation, with reporting on project spending. This definition incorporates several types of pipelines, as defined above: Investment Programs, Forward Pipelines, Priority Lists, and Project Trackers. Applying this broad definition captures more sources of intelligence and information on future projects/programs and also identifies more backward-looking information to inform future projects. 
Why are these pipelines important?
Pipelines are important because they provide a forward (and backward) view of planned investment, enabling government, industry, and communities to better plan and prepare for infrastructure development.

For governments, pipeline development is an essential step in planning infrastructure, which complements the government's infrastructure plans and project preparation practices (refer to Chapter 4 of GI Hub’s Project Preparation Reference Guide).
Industry needs pipelines to plan and prepare its resources both on a micro level (in pursuit of specific programs and projects) and a macro level (by using pipelines to identify market trends). Pipelines are also an important resource for attracting new entrants to infrastructure markets and for industry and academia to prioritise workforce education and upskilling programs.
Communities want pipelines so that they can see what is being built and when. Pipelines can be an effective tool to demonstrate transparency and build trust with communities.
